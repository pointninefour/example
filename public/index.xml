      <description>Introducing ScatterBowl!
ScatterBowl displays every combination of wickets taken and runs conceded in Big Bash cricket. Every time that a new combination is scored, a blue square will colour in the space on the figure. Currently there have been 231 entries.
This next table allows you to pin-point every spell that is displayed on ScatterBowl. Keep in mind, this only displays the first time that each combination has occurred.</description>

      <description>As BBL|08 is upon us, I decided to take a look over the past seven seasons and understand the Big Bash from a statistical standpoint. To be able to have such a large dataset has been a lot of fun and I’d love suggestions for further comparisons to be made. This first article will focus on batsmen, with future articles to follow on bowlers and teams.
This is also my first attempt at writing a blog post within RMarkdown, so be with me.</description>

      <description>“Point Nine Four” is a reference to possibly the most well-known statistic in Australian sport. The question appears anywhere from pub trivia of a Tuesday night, all the way to a question on the 23rd season of Hot Seat.
Q: “What was Sir Donald Bradman’s career batting average?”
A: “99.94”
Point Nine Four aims to show unusual or complex statistics regarding Australian sports in a meaningful and digestible format. Point Nine Four is designed to be read by lovers of sport, who still get a kick out of seeing some cool maths applied to enhance their love of sport.</description>
