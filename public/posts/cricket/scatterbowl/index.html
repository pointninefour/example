<p>Introducing ScatterBowl!</p>
<p>ScatterBowl displays every combination of wickets taken and runs conceded in Big Bash cricket. Every time that a new combination is scored, a blue square will colour in the space on the figure. Currently there have been 231 entries.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/cricket/2019-01-13-scatterbowl_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>This next table allows you to pin-point every spell that is displayed on ScatterBowl. Keep in mind, this only displays the first time that each combination has occurred. As a result, it means that the first BBL match contributed 11 spells to this figure.</p>

<p>Finally, this plot shows the density of each combination. The darker the shade, the more common the combination. <img src="/posts/cricket/2019-01-13-scatterbowl_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" /></p>
