<p>Introducing ScatterBat!</p>
<p>ScatterBat displays every combination of runs scored and balls faced in Big Bash cricket. Every time that a new combination is scored, a blue square will colour in the space on the figure. Currently there have been 1,137 entries. <img src="/posts/cricket/2019-01-06-scatterbat_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>This next table allows you to pin-point every innings that is displayed on ScatterBat. Keep in mind, this only displays the first time that each combination has occurred. As a result, it means that the first BBL match contributed 14 innings to this figure.</p>
