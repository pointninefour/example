      <title>BBL|08 Halfway Checkpoint</title>

      <description>BBL08 has reached the halfway mark, so let’s take a look back on the past four weeks of action to see what has unfolded so far. There has been much discussion around social media about whether lengthening the BBL season has led to a worse competition.
To begin with, let’s look at who our top batsmen are for BBL08. I’ve set a minimum of four innings to remove those that have an inflated average (such as Handscomb after only one match).</description>

      <description>Introducing ScatterBowl!
ScatterBowl displays every combination of wickets taken and runs conceded in Big Bash cricket. Every time that a new combination is scored, a blue square will colour in the space on the figure. Currently there have been 231 entries.
This next table allows you to pin-point every spell that is displayed on ScatterBowl. Keep in mind, this only displays the first time that each combination has occurred.</description>

      <description>As a follow-on from my previous blog post, the next article in this series of Big Bash posts is focusing on the bowlers in BBL. In the similar way as the past article, this is written in RMarkdown so I’d love feedback on how it is and what other content people would like to see!
Who is the highest wicket-taker in BBL?First, we will look at the top wicket-takers across the past seven seasons.</description>

      <title>An Analytical Guide to BBL - Batting</title>

      <description>As BBL|08 is upon us, I decided to take a look over the past seven seasons and understand the Big Bash from a statistical standpoint. To be able to have such a large dataset has been a lot of fun and I’d love suggestions for further comparisons to be made. This first article will focus on batsmen, with future articles to follow on bowlers and teams.
This is also my first attempt at writing a blog post within RMarkdown, so be with me.</description>
