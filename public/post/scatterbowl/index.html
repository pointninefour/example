<p>Introducing ScatterBat!</p>
<p>ScatterBowl displays every combination of wickets taken and runs conceded in Big Bash cricket. Every time that a new combination is scored, a blue square will colour in the space on the figure. Currently there have been 229 entries.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ScatterBowl &lt;- bowl %&gt;%

<p>This next table allows you to pin-point every spell that is displayed on ScatterBowl. Keep in mind, this only displays the first time that each combination has occurred. As a result, it means that the first BBL match contributed 11 spells to this figure.</p>
