      <description>Introducing ScatterBat!
ScatterBat displays every combination of runs scored and balls faced in Big Bash cricket. Every time that a new combination is scored, a blue square will colour in the space on the figure. Currently there have been 1168 entries. This next table allows you to pin-point every innings that is displayed on ScatterBat. Keep in mind, this only displays the first time that each combination has occurred.</description>
