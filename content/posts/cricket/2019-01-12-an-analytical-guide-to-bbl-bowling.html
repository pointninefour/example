<p>As a follow-on from my previous blog post, the next article in this series of Big Bash posts is focusing on the bowlers in BBL. In the similar way as the past article, this is written in RMarkdown so I’d love feedback on how it is and what other content people would like to see!</p>
<div id="who-is-the-highest-wicket-taker-in-bbl" class="section level2">
<h2>Who is the highest wicket-taker in BBL?</h2>
<p>First, we will look at the top wicket-takers across the past seven seasons. Here are the top 10:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sumBowl &lt;- bowl %&gt;% 
  group_by(Bowling) %&gt;%
  summarise(Innings = n(),Balls = sum(Balls), Wickets = sum(W), Runs = sum(R)) %&gt;%
  arrange(desc(Wickets))
ggplot(sumBowl %&gt;% head(10), 
       aes(x = reorder(Bowling,-Wickets), y = Wickets, fill = Bowling)) +
  geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) +
  geom_text(aes(label=Wickets), vjust=-0.3, size=3.5)+
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,100)) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  labs(title = &quot;Highest Wicket Takers&quot;, 
       x = &quot;Bowler&quot;, y = &quot;Frequency&quot;) +
  theme_ipsum_rc()  +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, vjust = 0.7))</code></pre>

<p>Ben Laughlin dominates the list with 85 wickets, with the likes of Abbott and Hoggy gaining podium positions. The ‘Wild Thing’ rounds out the top 10. However, wickets are not the only things that matter, the amount of runs conceded while taking wickets is also important, therefore things such as average, strike rates, and economy are also important to consider.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>statBowl &lt;- sumBowl

<p>We see Ish Sodhi, in only his 3 innings, rack up a healthy average and strike rate at a very respectable economy rate, while Lasith Malinga dominated in time over here with an average of 15.00 at an economy of only 5.40, one of only three bowlers with an economy rate below six (his national team mate Muralitharan with 5.70, and young gun Afghani Rashid Khan). So from there, there could be a trade-off between average, strike rate, and economy rate, so who has the Pareto-Optimal combination of these metrics?</p>

<p>Four players have Pareto-Optimal bowling statistics, Khan with a superior average, Starc with a superior strike rate, Malinga with a superior economy, and Arafat who has a lower strike rate than Khan and Malinga and a lower economy than Starc.</p>
<p>So then now we have figured out the Pareto-Optimal BBL bowlers, what is the most common dismissals in Big Bash?</p>
</div>
<div id="most-common-dismissals-in-big-bash" class="section level2">
<h2>Most Common Dismissals in Big Bash</h2>
<p>To do so, we need to use the batting data and see the dismissal method, rather than using the bowling data that the previous figures have used. However, there is a problem when you do this, see if you can spot it: (Hint: Have a think through the bowlers’ names)</p>

<p>By using the batting data, we only have the last name, and don’t have the unique name identifier usually used in the bowling data sets. As a result, it has combined Kane Richardson and Jhye Richardson’s dismissals into the same row. But after looking into the data we see that Kane contributed 14, which still places him equal 2nd on the list, while Jhye’s 5 don’t rank a mention.</p>
<p>But what about the dismissals that aren’t bowled, what are those most common dismissals?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>notBowled &lt;- dismissed %&gt;% filter(Mode != &#39;Bowled&#39;)

<p>Surprisingly, the dismissal ‘caught Travis Head, bowled Ben Laughlin’ is the highest alongside two spinners with eight dismissals. Johan Botha makes it on the list twice, with seven catches on Sean Abbott’s bowling and six run outs.</p>
<p>Although how about on an individual innings level, what is the most common bowling figured in Big Bash?</p>

<div id="what-are-the-most-common-bowling-figures" class="section level2">
<h2>What are the most common bowling figures?</h2>
<p>To do so, a plot is built, with the colour illustrating the density of the most common bowling figures.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(bowl, aes(R,W)) +
  geom_bin2d(binwidth = c(0.9999,0.9999)) +
  theme_ipsum_rc() +
  scale_fill_gradient(limits=c(0,100), 
                       breaks=seq(0, 100, by=20),
                       low = &quot;lightblue&quot;,
                       high = &quot;darkblue&quot;) +
  labs(x = &quot;Runs&quot;, y = &quot;Wickets&quot;,
       title = &quot;BBL Wickets by Runs&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/posts/cricket/2019-01-12-an-analytical-guide-to-bbl-bowling_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We see that the figures form a surprisngly normal distribution within each row of wickets. The most common figures lie between 0/5 to 0/38 and up to 2/20. However, two stark outliers are in the top left corner, one of whick is the best bowling figures in Big Bash - 6/7 by Lasith Malinga.</p>
<p>However, as previously mentioned, economy rate can also contribute to a bowler’s performance, so is there any other Pareto-Optimal bowling innings?</p>

<p>One other bowler joins the picture, the man Mitchell Johnson with 3/3 off 4 overs at an economy of only 0.75.</p>
