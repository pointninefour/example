As a follow-on from my previous blog post, the next article in this series of Big Bash posts is focusing on the bowlers in BBL. 
In the similar way as the past article, this is written in RMarkdown so I'd love feedback on how it is and what other content people would like to see!

## Who is the highest wicket-taker in BBL?

First, we will look at the top wicket-takers across the past seven seasons. Here are the top 10:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
sumBowl <- bowl %>% 
  group_by(Bowling) %>%
  summarise(Innings = n(),Balls = sum(Balls), Wickets = sum(W), Runs = sum(R)) %>%
  arrange(desc(Wickets))
ggplot(sumBowl %>% head(10), 
       aes(x = reorder(Bowling,-Wickets), y = Wickets, fill = Bowling)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  geom_text(aes(label=Wickets), vjust=-0.3, size=3.5)+
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,100)) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Highest Wicket Takers", 
       x = "Bowler", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_ipsum_rc()  +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, vjust = 0.7))
```

Ben Laughlin dominates the list with 85 wickets, with the likes of Abbott and Hoggy gaining podium positions. The 'Wild Thing' rounds out the top 10. However, wickets are not the only things that matter, the amount of runs conceded while taking wickets is also important, therefore things such as average, strike rates, and economy are also important to consider.

```{r}
statBowl <- sumBowl
statBowl$Average <- statBowl$Runs/statBowl$Wickets
statBowl$Economy <- statBowl$Runs/statBowl$Balls*6
statBowl$StrikeRate <- statBowl$Balls/statBowl$Wickets
statBowl <- statBowl %>% 
  arrange(Average) %>%
    mutate_at(vars(Average, Economy, StrikeRate), funs(round(., 3)))
datatable(statBowl %>%
  select(Bowling,Average,Economy,StrikeRate))
```

We see Ish Sodhi, in only his 3 innings, rack up a healthy average and strike rate at a very respectable economy rate, while Lasith Malinga dominated in time over here with an average of 15.00 at an economy of only 5.40, one of only three bowlers with an economy rate below six (his national team mate Muralitharan with 5.70, and young gun Afghani Rashid Khan).
So from there, there could be a trade-off between average, strike rate, and economy rate, so who has the Pareto-Optimal combination of these metrics?

## Pareto-Optimal Career Bowling Figures
``` {r}
paretoCareerBowl <- psel(statBowl %>% 
                         select(Bowling,Average,Economy,StrikeRate), 
                         low(Average)*low(Economy)*low(StrikeRate))
datatable(paretoCareerBowl, options = list(dom = 't'))

```

We see Sodhi who tops the average and strike rate, Malinga who tops the economy, and Khan who has the third best average and third best economy. However, as Ish has only bowled in three innings, if we set a minimum 10 innings, we start to see only one different bowler enter the fray:

``` {r}
paretoCareerBowl <- psel(statBowl %>% filter(Innings >= 10) %>% 
                         select(Bowling,Average,Economy,StrikeRate), 
                         low(Average)*low(Economy)*low(StrikeRate))
paretoCareerBowl %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"), full_width = F, position = "center")
```
Four players have Pareto-Optimal bowling statistics, Khan with a superior average, Starc with a superior strike rate, Malinga with a superior economy, and Arafat who has a lower strike rate than Khan and Malinga and a lower economy than Starc.

So then now we have figured out the Pareto-Optimal BBL bowlers, what is the most common dismissals in Big Bash?

## Most Common Dismissals in Big Bash

To do so, we need to use the batting data and see the dismissal method, rather than using the bowling data that the previous figures have used.
However, there is a problem when you do this, see if you can spot it:
(Hint: Have a think through the bowlers' names)

```{r, warning=FALSE}
uniqueDismissal <- as.data.frame(table(dismissed$Dismissal))
uniqueDismissal <- uniqueDismissal %>% arrange(desc(Freq))
colnames(uniqueDismissal) <- c("Dismissal","Frequency")
ggplot(uniqueDismissal %>% filter(Frequency >= 10), 
       aes(x = reorder(Dismissal,Frequency), y = Frequency, fill = Dismissal)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Most Common BBL Dismissals", 
       x = "Mode of Dismissal", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_ipsum_rc()
```

By using the batting data, we only have the last name, and don't have the unique name identifier usually used in the bowling data sets. As a result, it has combined Kane Richardson and Jhye Richardson's dismissals into the same row. But after looking into the data we see that Kane contributed 14, which still places him equal 2nd on the list, while Jhye's 5 don't rank a mention.

But what about the dismissals that aren't bowled, what are those most common dismissals?

``` {r}
notBowled <- dismissed %>% filter(Mode != 'Bowled')
uniqueDismissal <- as.data.frame(table(notBowled$Dismissal))
uniqueDismissal <- uniqueDismissal %>% arrange(desc(Freq))
colnames(uniqueDismissal) <- c("Dismissal","Frequency")
datatable(uniqueDismissal %>% filter (Frequency > 5),options = list(dom = 't'))
```

Surprisingly, the dismissal 'caught Travis Head, bowled Ben Laughlin' is the highest alongside two spinners with eight dismissals. Johan Botha makes it on the list twice, with seven catches on Sean Abbott's bowling and six run outs.

Although how about on an individual innings level, what is the most common bowling figured in Big Bash?

## What are the most common bowling figures?

To do so, a plot is built, with the colour illustrating the density of the most common bowling figures.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(bowl, aes(R,W)) +
  geom_bin2d(binwidth = c(0.9999,0.9999)) +
  theme_ipsum_rc() +
  scale_fill_gradient(limits=c(0,100), 
                       breaks=seq(0, 100, by=20),
                       low = "lightblue",
                       high = "darkblue") +
  labs(x = "Runs", y = "Wickets",
       title = "BBL Wickets by Runs")
```

We see that the figures form a surprisngly normal distribution within each row of wickets. The most common figures lie between 0/5 to 0/38 and up to 2/20. However, two stark outliers are in the top left corner, one of whick is the best bowling figures in Big Bash - 6/7 by Lasith Malinga.

However, as previously mentioned, economy rate can also contribute to a bowler's performance, so is there any other Pareto-Optimal bowling innings?

## What are the best bowling figures in Big Bash?
``` {r}
bowlPareto <- psel(bowl, high(W)*low(Econ)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(W)) %>% 
  select(Bowling, O, W, R, Econ)
bowlPareto %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"), full_width = F, position = "center") %>%
  add_header_above(c("Pareto-Optimal BBL Bowling Honour Board"=5))
```

One other bowler joins the picture, the man Mitchell Johnson with 3/3 off 4 overs at an economy of only 0.75.

So that wraps up Part 2 of this series looking at the Big Bash. Keen to get feedback on what you liked and what you'd like to see more of, you can contact me by either commenting on this post or by tweeting to me @pointninefour.
