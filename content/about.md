“Point Nine Four” is a reference to possibly the most well-known statistic in Australian sport. The question appears anywhere from pub trivia of a Tuesday night, all the way to a question on the 23rd season of Hot Seat.

<strong>Q:</strong> “What was Sir Donald Bradman’s career batting average?”

<strong>A:</strong> “99.<strong>94</strong>”

Point Nine Four aims to show unusual or complex statistics regarding Australian sports in a meaningful and digestible format. Point Nine Four is designed to be read by lovers of sport, who still get a kick out of seeing some cool maths applied to enhance their love of sport.
